NOTE: the original rgmc clustering (algorithms: RG, CGGC_RG, CGGCi_RG)
did not output resulting clusters. This is a modified version that fixes
this bug and outputs clusters to be able to compare them against the
ground-truth.
This is a significantly refactored version with updated I/O (full support of
the official Metis format of the input graph), but untouched original
clustering algorithm(s).

-- Prerequisites ---------------------------------------------
1. Boost libraries (http://www.boost.org/) 
The code has been tested with Boost version 1.42.
Debian/Ubuntu users can run "sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev"

2. Make
only needed, if you want to use the makefile

-- Build ------------------------------------------------------
The source code comes with a makefile. Run make to build the program.
Compiler/Linker errors are most likely due to incorrect 
settings of include and lib paths.  


-- Run --------------------------------------------------------
Run rgmc with the following parameters:
  --file arg               input graph file in Metis (,graph) or Pajek (.net) format (vid >= 1), UNWEIGHTED
  --k arg (=2)             sample size of RG
  --finalk arg (=2000)     sample size for final RG step
  --runs arg (=1)          number of RG runs from which to pick the best result
  --ensemblesize arg (=-1) size of ensemble for ensemble algorithms (-1 = 
                           ln(#vertices))
  --algorithm arg (=1)     algorithm: 1: RG, 2: CGGC_RG, 3: CGGCi_RG
  --outfile arg            file to store the detected communities
  --outfmt {c, v}          output file format, default: c:
    c  - each line contains unwrapped clusters, i.e. list of the member vertices (ids)
    v  - each lie corresponds to the vertex and contains it's owner cluster (id)
  --seed arg               seed value to initialize random number generator


Example:

$ rgmc --file=test.graph --algorithm=3 --outfile=test.out
runs the CGGCi_RG algorithm on the graph test.graph and writes the results to
test.out
$ rgmc --file=email.graph
